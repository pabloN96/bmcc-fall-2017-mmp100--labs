# Lab 5 — First Web Page

For this lab, you’ll create a single web page about a musician or group whose music you enjoy, then upload that page to the MMP servers. **Submit this lab by issuing a pull request to the original repo by 11:00 AM on Thursday, 19 October 2017**. We’ll go over *a* solution in class on the due date.

1. Inside the `lab-5` folder, create a valid, W3-compliant HTML document called `index.html`.
2. Visit [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/) and choose two fonts: one for display, or headings, and one for reading, or text.
3. Describe the musician/group to the audience. Where are they from? What music is their specialty? Why is this person/group your favorite? **These must be your own words, not content copied from a web site.**
4. Locate two images online of the musician/group you’re using for this project.
5. Employ both images in your page by linking to the external URLs. **Do not download the image files into this repo.** Use `width` or `height` to adjust the size of the images to your liking.
6. Wrap the images in links that take the user to the page where you found the images.
7. In terms of CSS, you’ll need to use — at the very least — the following properties: `background-color`, `color`, `font`, `text-align`.
8. In terms of HTML, you’ll need to use some or all of the following: `h1`…`h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `section`, `div`, `img`.
9. Once you’ve verified that your code complies with the [HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), upload your `index.html` file to the MMP servers using your MMP server account.
